  <h1>About Usuls.com</h1><br/>
  <p>
  Usuls.com is a site where users of Neopets can find and list 
  pets up for trade or up for adoption.  You'll be able to create an account 
  and profile that will show all your pets up for trade and adoption when another 
  user clicks on your profile.  Users can then message you through the site, 
  or through Neopets if you provide your UN!

  <h2>How to Use the Site</h2><br/>
  <p>You can contact users directly through in-house messaging, or on Neopets
  directly if they have their username listed on their profile.</p>
  <p>If you are no longer trading a pet, whether you already traded it or simply 
  changed your mind, it is recommended that you remove them from the site to 
  prevent people from making unwanted contact.</p>
  <p>You can find all pets currently available by visiting the "Pets" tab, or 
  you may use the search functions on the Home page to filter your results.</p>
  <p>Pet information can be changed or updated at any point in time, as often 
  as you need. To do so, visit a pet's profile and select "Edit." If you are 
  only updating the color or species, you do not need to manually change 
  the fields. Simply selecting "List Pet" will automatically update them.</p>
  <p>If you see anything malicious or unwanted on the site, including pets 
  that should not be listed, please contact us through the <%= link_to "report form", new_report_path %> 
  and an admin will take care of it ASAP.</p>
